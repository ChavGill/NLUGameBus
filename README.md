# NLUGameBus
This is a website I created for a client. This is an active site for Next Level Up Game Bus

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I was able to create a site for them. This website helped them to close a contract with a school in our city.
This website gives insight on the company, their services and their fees. Also provides some clickable media to see the bus as well as a 
contact section, as they prefer phone and e-mail for booking their services.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

As her staff increases, I will add their images and create a quick profile bio for them.

## Takeways/New Lessons

Utlilizing the sidebar nav and hamburger menu was a good learning challenge, especially when adjusting responsiveness for mobile. As this site is not in use as of yet, I 
will finalize with the client on the last details.
