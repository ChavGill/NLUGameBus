# NLUGameBus
This is a website I created for a client. This is an active site for Next Level Up Game Bus
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I was able to create a site for them. This website helped them to close a contract with a school in our city.
This website gives insight on the company, their services and their fees. Also provides some clickable media to see the bus as well as a 
contact section, as they prefer phone and e-mail for booking their services.
