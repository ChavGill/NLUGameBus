# NLUGameBus
This is a website I created for a client. This is an active site for Next Level Up Game Bus

**Link to project:**https://www.nlugamebus.com/

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I was able to create a site for them. This website helped them to close a contract with a school in our city.
This website gives insight on the company, their services and their fees. Also provides some clickable media to see the bus as well as a 
contact section, as they prefer phone and e-mail for booking their services.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

As more media and pictures are made, I would like to make them a lot more interactive. Also, a full list of the video games would be a very nice touch,

## Takeways/New Lessons

This was my 1st client site and utilizing a template was a learning experience, especially in the time frame I had available but the pressure turned out well and I helped my cleint secure major contracts.
